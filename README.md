### To keep in mind...
Before executing any of the following commands, it is important to take into account to create the "Alias" in our local computer which is configured in the file located in /etc/hosts but we make it easier using the file found in this repository called <br>setup_alias_ssh</br>.
It is important to configure the "Alias" since it will be used in the correct execution of all the files contained in this repository.
